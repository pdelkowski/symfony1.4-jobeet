# About This Guide
This guide documents the major functionality that JPUP provides.  It can be
  considered a user reference guide with cookbook elements.

This guide does not contain API documentation, nor does it cover topics that
  might be of interest to developers who wish to make changes to JPUP itself.

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you are already familiar with PHPUnit and unit-testing
  PHP applications.

For an introduction to unit testing and how to write PHPUnit test cases, see
  [the PHPUnit manual](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/).

# Where to Put Test Files
The organization of PHPUnit tests is very similar to the way Symfony tests are
  laid out.

All tests should be stored in the `test` directory under the project root
  directory (matches the value of `sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir')`).

## Unit Tests
Unit tests should be stored under `sf_test_dir/unit`.  For best results, create
  subdirectories and name your test case files to match the corresponding
  library files that they are testing.

For example, the unit tests for `lib/model/Profile.class.php` should be stored
  in `sf_test_dir/unit/lib/model/Profile.class.php`.

* JPUP does not care what the files are named, but by following this file naming
  convention, you can leverage readline's autocomplete feature when you are
  running tests via PHPUnit Symfony tasks.

## Functional Tests
Functional tests should be stored under `sf_test_dir/functional`.  Use
  subdirectories to group functional tests by application and module.

For example, the functional tests for `accountActions->executeRegister()` (e.g.,
  http://www.example.com/account/register) should be stored in
  `sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/account/register.php`.

Note that this differs from the way Symfony's built-in test framework organizes
  functional tests; Symfony's module generator creates e.g.,
  `sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/accountActionsTest.php`.

* Just as with unit tests, JPUP does not actually care how you organize your
  tests.  You can create a single functional test case for each module if you want;
  we just found that it's more efficient for us to locate and run tests when they
  are organized by module *and* action.

# Writing Tests
## Writing Unit Tests
Writing a unit test for JPUP is very similar to writing [test cases for
  vanilla PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html),
  but there are a few differences to keep in mind:

- Have your test class extend `Test_Case_Unit`, **not**
  `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`.

- For setup and teardown functionality, define the `_setUp()` and `_tearDown()`
  methods, respectively, in your test class (note the leading underscore in the
  method names).

Here is an example of what a unit test class looks like:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/lib/Widget/WidgetService.class.php

    <?php
    class WidgetServiceTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      private
        /** @var WidgetService_Http_Client_Mock */
        $_client;

      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        /* Inject mock HTTP adapter so that we can simulate/control Widget
         *  Service responses.
         */
        $this->_client = new WidgetService_Http_Client_Mock();
        WidgetService::setHttpClient($this->_client);
      }

      public function testGetNumberOfLikes(  )
      {
        $like_count   = '25';
        $object_type  = 'page';
        $object_id    = '123';

        /* Seed the response from the Widget server. */
        $this->_client->seed(
          sprintf(
            '/likes/count?object_type=%s&object_id=%d',
              $object_type,
              $object_id
          ),

          json_encode(array(
            'status'  => 'OK',
            'likes'   => $like_count
          ))
        );

        /* Execute the API method and check the result. */
        $this->assertEquals(
          $like_count,
          WidgetService::getNumberOfLikes($object_type, $object_id),
          'Expected correct number of likes returned.'
        );
      }
    }

### Generating Unit Tests Automatically
JPUP comes packaged with a Symfony task named `phpunit:generate-unit` to build
  unit tests for you automatically.

To use `phpunit:generate-unit`, you must first create the class skeleton, as the
  task will use Symfony's auto-loader to locate the class file.  You can also
  generate unit tests for a class that you have already added methods to (the
  task will create skeleton tests for you).

For example, suppose you wanted to create a test case for this class:

    # sf_lib_dir/HelloWorld.class.php

    <?php
    /** My first PHP class!
     *
     * @package myproject
     * @subpackage helloworld
     */
    class HelloWorld
    {
      /** Returns everyone's favorite phrase.
       *
       * @return string
       */
      public function getString(  )
      {
        return 'Hello, World!';
      }

      /** Returns a generic string representation of the object.
       *
       * @return string
       */
      public function __toString(  )
      {
        return $this->getString();
      }
    }

To build a skeleton test case for the `HelloWorld` class as defined in the above
  example, execute the following command:

    ./symfony phpunit:generate-unit HelloWorld

Note that you must pass the **class name** to the task.  This is a requirement
  to avoid ambiguity when a class file contains multiple class definitions.

* JPUP does not support generating tests for multiple classes in the same file.
    If you want test cases for multiple classes that are defined in the same
    file, you will either need to create the test cases by hand or split out the
    classes into separate files.

`phpunit:generate-unit` will create a test case for you in `sf_test_dir/unit`,
  and it will create subdirectories as needed so that the directory structure
  matches the location of the class file.

In the example above, the test case file will be created at
  `sf_test_dir/unit/lib/HelloWorld.class.php` that looks something like this:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/lib/HelloWorld.class.php

    <?php
    /** Unit tests for HelloWorld.
     *
     * @author PHX
     *
     * @package myproject
     * @subpackage test.helloworld
     */
    class HelloWorldTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
      }

      public function testGetString(  )
      {
        $this->markTestIncomplete('Not implemented yet.');
      }
    }

Note that JPUP automatically populates the `@package`, `@subpackage` and
  `@author` phpdoc tags from the class docblock, and it creates skeleton tests
  for any public, non-magic methods it finds in the class.

* If the class does not have a `@package` tag, JPUP will try to use the name of
  the project as defined in `sf_config_dir/properties.ini`.

* If the class does not have a `@subpackage` tag, JPUP will try to guess one
  based on the class file's location in the project's directory structure.

* If the class does not have an `@author` tag, JPUP will try to use the name of
  the project author as defined in `sf_config_dir/properties.ini`.

* The template for the skeleton test case is located in
  `sf_root_dir/plugins/sfJwtPhpUnitPlugin/lib/task/phpunit/skeleton/unit.php`.

  If desired, you can create your own template.  JPUP will first check for a
  skeleton file at `sf_data_dir/skeleton/phpunit/unit.php`.

* You may customize the values of any tokens, such as the package or subpackage
  names (or any additional tokens in your custom skeleton file) by passing
  `--token` arguments to the task.

  For example, to change the `@package` of the test case to "MyAwesomeProject",
  you would invoke the task like this:

        ./symfony phpunit:generate-unit --token='package:MyAwesomeProject' HelloWorld

### Testing Symfony Tasks
To execute a symfony task in a test, call `$this->runTask()`:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/lib/task/HelloTask.class.php

    <?php
    /** Unit tests for HelloTask.
     *
     * @author PHX
     *
     * @package myproject
     * @subpackage test.lib
     */
    class HelloTaskTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected
        $_name  = 'hello:user';

      public function testExecuteTask(  )
      {
        $user = 'Joey';
        $bang = '!';

        $status = $this->runTask(
          $this->_name,
          array($user),
          array(
            'punctuation' => $bang
          )
        );
        $this->assertEquals(0, $status, 'Expected task to complete successfully.');
      }
    }

`runTask()` takes up to three parameters:

- The name of the task (required).
- Array of arguments (optional).
- Array of options (optional).

`runTask()` returns an integer status code, which is the status code that would
  be reported to the shell were this task run via the `symfony` command-line
  interface.

- Note that at this time there is no way to capture output from the task
  execution.

## Writing Functional Tests
Functional tests are very similar to unit tests as described above, but you also
  have access to `$this->_browser` which is an instance of a modified version of
  the `sfBrowser` class:  `Test_Browser`.

Also, functional test classes should extend the `Test_Case_Functional` class
  rather than `Test_Case_Unit`.

Here is an example of a functional test class:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/account/register.php

    <?php
    class frontend_account_registerTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        /* Activate additional browser plugins. */
        $this->_browser->usePlugin('form', 'mailer');

        $username = 'mytester';
        $password = 'password';
        $email    = 'tester@jwt.com';

        /* Send browser to the registration form page. */
        $this->_browser->get('@account_register');
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        /* Simulate form submission. */
        $this->_browser->click('Submit', array(
          'username' => $username,
          'password' => $password,
          'email'    => $email
        ));

        /* Check assertions. */
        $this->assertFalse(
          $this->_browser->getForm()->hasErrors(),
          'Expected form to have no errors.'
        );

        $this->assertNotNull(
          Doctrine::getTable('Profile')->retrieveByUsername($username),
          'Expected Profile record to be created successfully.'
        );

        $Mailer = $this->_browser->getMailer();
        $this->assertEquals(
          1,
          $Mailer->countMessages(),
          'Expected welcome email to be dispatched.'
        );

        $this->assertEquals(
          $email,
          $Mailer->getMessage(0)->getTo(),
          'Expected welcome email to be sent to the user.'
        );

        $this->assertEquals(
          'account/home',
          $this->_browser->getResponse()->getRedirectUrl(),
          'Expected browser to be redirected to account homepage.'
        );

        /* Follow the redirect. */
        $this->_browser->followRedirect();
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        $this->assertEquals(
          sprintf('Welcome, %s!', $username),
          $this->_browser->getContent()->select('#welcome')->getValue(),
          "Expected success page to display user's new username."
        );
      }
    }

### Generating Functional Tests Automatically
JPUP comes packaged with a Symfony task named `phpunit:generate-functional` to
  build functional tests for you automatically.

To use `phpunit:generate-functional`, you must first create the module and
  action you wish to test and wire it into your application's `routing.yml`.

Once that is done, invoke the task like this:

    ./symfony phpunit:generate-functional <route>

Where `<route>` is either a route name (prefixed with `@`) or a module/action
  pair.

For example, consider if your application's `routing.yml` looked like this:

    # sf_app_dir/config/routing.yml

    # default rules
    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: main, action: index }

    # generic rules
    # please, remove them by adding more specific rules
    default_index:
      url:   /:module
      param: { action: index }

    default:
      url:   /:module/:action/*

You could generate a functional test case for `main/index` using either of the
  following commands:

    ./symfony phpunit:generate-functional @homepage
    ./symfony phpunit:generate-functional main/index

* By default, JPUP will look at the routing for the "frontend" application.  If
    you want to generate a functional test for a different application, you will
    need to specify it using the `--application` parameter:

        ./symfony phpunit:generate-functional --application=backend @activitylogs

JPUP will generate a skeleton test case for you that looks something like this:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/main/index.php

    <?php
    /** Functional tests for /main/index.
     *
     * @author PHX
     *
     * @package myproject
     * @subpackage test.main
     */
    class frontend_main_indexTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      protected
        $_application = 'frontend',
        $_url;

      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        $this->_url = '/main/index';
      }

      public function testSmokeCheck(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->get($this->_url);
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);
      }
    }

Note that, just like `phpunit:generate-unit`, `phpunit:generate-functional`
  automatically populates the `@package`, `@subpackage` and `@author` phpdoc
  tags from the class docblock.

* If the action class does not have a `@package` tag, JPUP will try to use the
    name of the project as defined in `sf_config_dir/properties.ini`.

* If the action class does not have a `@subpackage` tag, JPUP will try to guess
    one based on the module and action names.

* If the class does not have an `@author` tag, JPUP will try to use the name of
    the project author as defined in `sf_config_dir/properties.ini`.

* The template for the skeleton test case is located in
    `sf_root_dir/plugins/sfJwtPhpUnitPlugin/lib/task/phpunit/skeleton/functional.php`.

    If desired, you can create your own template.  JPUP will first check for a
      skeleton file at `sf_data_dir/skeleton/phpunit/functional.php`.

* You may customize the values of any tokens, such as the package or subpackage
    names (or any additional tokens in your custom skeleton file) by passing
    `--token` arguments to the task.

  For example, to change the `@package` of the test case to "MyAwesomeProject",
    you would invoke the task like this:

        ./symfony phpunit:generate-functional --token='package:MyAwesomeProject' main/index

### Requesting URLs

`Test_Browser->call()` accepts the same format for URIs as the `url_for()`
  helper, so you can pass in a URI, a route name or even an array of routing
  parameters.

For example, suppose you wanted to write a functional test against an action
  that has the following entry in `routing.yml`:

    # sf_app_config_dir/routing.yml

    account_contact:
      url:          /account/contact/:username
      class:          sfDoctrineRoute
      options:
        model:        sfGuardUser
        type:         object
      param:
        module:       account
        action:       show
      requirements:
        sf_method:    [get,post]

The functional test might look something like this:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/account/contact.php

    <?php
    class frontend_account_contactTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testViewUserProfile(  )
      {
        $user = new sfGuardUser();
        ...
        $user->save();

        /* You can pass the URI directly just like for sfTestFunctional: */
        $this->_browser->get('/account/contact/' . $user->getUsername());
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        /* Or use the route name and parameters: */
        $this->_browser->get('@account_contact?username=' . $user->getUsername());
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        /* Or pass an array of route parameters: */
        $this->_browser->get(array(
          'sf_route'    => 'account_contact',
          'sf_subject'  => $user
        ));
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);
      }
    }

#### Query String Parameters

Because `Test_Browser` is based on `sfBrowser`, its `call()` method also accepts
  a `$parameters` argument, but note that these parameters are added to the
  request *after* parsing the route.

It is recommended that you only use `$parameters` to specify `POST` data:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/account/contact.php

    <?php
    class frontend_account_contactTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSendUserAnEmail(  )
      {
        $user = new sfGuardUser();
        ...
        $user->save();

        try
        {
          /* This will cause an error because the 'username' parameter will not
           *  get included when parsing the route:
           */
          $this->_browser->post('@account_contact', array(
            'username'  => $user->username,
            'message'   => 'Hello, username!'
          ));

          $this->fail(
            'Expected exception when required route parameter is missing.'
          );
        }
        catch( InvalidArgumentException $e )
        {
        }

        /* This will work as expected: */
        $this->_browser->post(
          array(
            'sf_route'    => 'account_show',
            'sf_subject'  => $user
          ),
          array(
            'message'     => 'Hello, username!'
          )
        );
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);
      }
    }

### Signing In
Testing applications that require login is a tricky proposition.  It's easy
  enough to sign a user in, but every time the browser makes a request, it
  destroys and rebuilds the application context, which logs the user back out!

`Test_Browser` provides a `signin()` method to solve this problem.  Simply pass
  in a username or email address, and the browser will make sure the user is
  logged in during the next and subsequent requests:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/admin/dashboard.php

    <?php
    class frontend_admin_dashboardTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      protected
        $_route = '@admin_dashboard';

      public function testMustBeLoggedIn(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->get($this->_route);
        $this->assertStatusCode(401);
      }

      public function testUserCanAccessIfSignedIn(  )
      {
        $this->loadFixture('admin_user.php');
        $this->_browser->signin('administrator');

        $this->_browser->get($this->_route);
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);
      }

      /** Note that the user is logged out again at the start of the next
       *    test.
       */
      public function testSigninOnlyLastsForTheDurationOfTheTest(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->get($this->_route);
        $this->assertStatusCode(401);
      }
    }

Note from the last test in the example above that the user will only remain
  signed in for the duration of the test in which the call to `signin()` was
  made.  If you want the user to be logged in during another test, you will need
  to call `signin()` again, or move that code into your test case's `_setUp()`
  method.

### Interacting with the Symfony Application Context
While building JPUP, we found that there were a number of features that
  the `sfTestFunctional` classes afforded that are extraordinarily useful for
  testing but are not accessible to `sfBrowser`.

After a lot of experimentation, we started developing a series of plugins that
  encapsulate properties of the Symfony context, adding extra features and
  exposing more of the objects' internals without restricting their respective
  APIs.

Here is the full list of plugins that come with JPUP:

- Content
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getContent()`
  - HTML response text container.
  - Also includes methods for decoding serialized content and interacting with
    Symfony's `sfDomCssSelector`.

- Error
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getError()`
  - Makes accessible the uncaught exception from the request if applicable
    (useful for debugging HTTP 500 response codes).

- Form
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getForm($var = null)`
  - Makes accessible the `sfForm` instance bound to the Symfony action if
    applicable.

- Logger
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getLogger()`
  - Injects an `sfVarLogger` into the context so that log messages can be
    inspected.

- Mailer
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getMailer()`
  - SwiftMailer log (`sfMailerMessageLoggerPlugin`).
  - Also provides methods for searching messages by header or position.

- Request
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getRequest()`
  - Symfony Request object (`sfWebRequest`).
  - Also provides methods for determining whether and where a request was
    forwarded.

- Response
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getResponse()`
  - Symfony Response object (`sfWebResponse`).
  - Also provides methods for determining whether and where a response was
    redirected.

- Var
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getVar($var)`
  - Returns any variable that has been added to the action's var holder (made
    accessible to the view).

- ViewCache
  - Usage:  `$this->_browser->getViewCache()`
  - Makes accessible the view cache manager (`sfViewCacheManager`).

The Form, Mailer, Var and ViewCache plugins are not used that frequently and
  need to be activated before they can be used (by calling
  `$this->_browser->usePlugin('...')`; see individual plugin sections for
  more information).

For complete API documentation of browser plugins, see the PHPDoc-generated
  documentation.

Here are some examples of use cases where `Test_Browser` plugins come in handy:

#### Testing Service Calls
A number of applications expose services that return serialized or JSON-encoded
  values instead of HTML content.  Manually parsing the content these requests
  would quickly become tedious; fortunately, the Content plugin provides methods
  to handle this automatically:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/do/like.php

    <?php
    class frontend_do_likeTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->post('@like', array(
          'user_id'     => '1',
          'object_id'   => '123'
        ));

        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        /* (string) $this->_browser->getContent() would evaluate to:
         * '{"status":"OK","likes":"1"}'
         *
         * To work with the decoded JSON code, use:
         */
        $decoded = $this->_browser->getContent()->decodeJson();

        $this->assertEquals(
          'OK',
          $decoded->status,
          'Expected success status value.'
        );

        $this->assertEquals(
          1,
          $decoded->likes,
          'Expected correctly-incremented number of likes.'
        );
      }
    }

* The Content plugin also has a `deserialize()` method for output encoded with
  PHP's `serialize()` function.

* Note:  `$this->_browser->getContent()` returns an instance of
  `Test_Browser_Plugin_Content`.  If you want the raw text from the response,
  cast it as a string or invoke its `__toString()` method.

#### Testing Form Submissions
To access a submitted form, use the Form plugin:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/contactus/reportissue.php

    <?php
    class frontend_main_reportissueTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        /* The Form plugin has to be activated before it can be used. */
        $this->_browser->usePlugin('form');

        $this->_browser->get('@reportissue');
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        $this->_browser->click('Submit', array(
          'issue' => array(
            'firstname'   => 'Functional',
            'lastname'    => 'Tester',
            'email'       => 'functional_tester@jwt.com',
            'description' => 'This is a test form submission.'
          )
        ));

        /* Access the submitted form. */
        $Form = $this->_browser->getForm();

        $this->assertFalse(
          $Form->hasErrors(),
          'Expected form to have no errors.'
        );
      }
    }

* As it is not used very often, the Form plugin is not enabled by default.  To
  use it in your test, call `$this->_browser->usePlugin('form')`.

* By default, the Form plugin will only fetch a single *bound* `sfForm` instance
  from the action stack.  If an action utilizes more than one bound form, this
  plugin will only return one of them (whichever one was assigned to the
  action's variable holder first).

    If you need to retrieve a specific form instance, you can pass its name to
    `getForm()`.  As an example, consider the following action:

        # sf_app_module_dir/feedback/actions/actions.class.php

        class feedbackActions extends sfActions
        {
          public function executeContact( sfWebRequest $request )
          {
            $this->cForm   = new ContactForm();
            $this->riForm  = new ReportIssueForm();

            if( $request->getMethod() == sfWebRequest::POST )
            {
              $this->cForm->bind(
                $request->getPostParameter($this->cForm->getName())
              );

              ...

              $this->riForm->bind(
                $request->getPostParameter($this->riForm->getName())
              );
            }

            ...
          }
        }

    To interact with the `ReportIssueForm` instance in your test case, you would
    need to access it like this:

        # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/feedback/contact.php

        class frontend_feedback_contactTest extends Test_Case_Functional
        {
          protected
            $_application = 'frontend',
            $_url         = '@contactus';

          public function testReportIssue(  )
          {
            $this->_browser->usePlugin('form');

            $this->_browser->post($this->_url, array(...));
            $this->assertStatusCode(200);

            /* Extract the ReportIssueForm from the context. */
            $form = $this->_browser->getForm('riForm');

            ...
          }
        }

#### Testing Emails
To interact with Symfony's built in mailer, use the Mailer plugin:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/contactus/reportissue.php

    <?php
    class frontend_main_reportissueTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        /* The Mailer plugin has to be activated before it can be used. */
        $this->_browser->usePlugin('mailer');

        $email = 'functional_tester@jwt.com';

        $this->_browser
          ->get('@reportissue')
          ->click('Submit', array(
              'issue' => array(
                'firstname'   => 'Functional',
                'lastname'    => 'Tester',
                'email'       => $email,
                'description' => 'This is a test form submission.'
              )
            ));

        ... snip ...

        /* Test emails sent from form submission. */
        $Mailer = $this->_browser->getMailer();

        $this->assertEquals(
          2,
          $Mailer->countMessages(),
          'Expected correct number of emails to be sent.'
        );

        /* Get the email that was sent to the user. */
        $Message = $Mailer->getMessageWith('to', $email);
        $this->assertNotNull(
          $Message,
          'Expected an email to be sent to the user.'
        );

        $this->assertEquals(
          sfConfig::get('app_webmaster_email'),
          $Message->getFrom(),
          'Expected email sent to user to be from system administrator.'
        );
      }
    }

* As it is not used very often, the Mailer plugin is not enabled by default.
  To use it in your test, call `$this->_browser->usePlugin('mailer')`.

* The Mailer plugin only interacts with Symfony's built-in SwiftMailer emailer.
  If you are using your own mailer, you will need to write your own interface
  for interacting with it for testing.

#### Testing Redirects
The Request and Response plugins provide access to forwarding and redirecting
  information, respectively.

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/contactus/reportissue.php

    <?php
    class frontend_contactus_reportissueTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSubmission(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->get('@reportissue');
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        $this->_browser->click('Submit', array(...));

        ... snip ...

        $this->assertEquals(
          '/contactus/reportissue/thankyou',
          $this->_browser->getResponse()->getRedirectURL(),
          'Expected browser to be redirected to the confirmation page.'
        );
      }

      public function testForwardIfNoSubmission(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->get('@reportissue_confirmation');

        $this->assertEquals(
          'contactus/reportissue',
          $this->_browser->getRequest()->getForwardString(),
          'Expected request to be forwarded to form.'
        );
      }
    }

* The test browser will not follow redirects automatically.  To follow a
  redirect, call `$this->_browser->followRedirect()`.

  This only applies to redirects; forwards are followed automatically.

* For an explanation of the difference between redirecting and forwarding,
  see [this blog post](http://firebird84vn.wordpress.com/2007/06/30/skipping-to-another-action/).

#### Troubleshooting 500 Errors
When applications generate 500 errors, Symfony will forward the request to a
  generic error page, which makes troubleshooting these problems in functional
  tests particularly frustrating.

Fortunately, the Error plugin makes it easy to get information (including a
  stack trace) about any uncaught exceptions the application generates:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/contactus/reportissue.php

    <?php
    class frontend_main_reportissueTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        $this->_browser
          ->get('@reportissue')
          ->click('Submit', array(
              'issue' => array(
                'firstname'   => 'Functional',
                'lastname'    => 'Tester',
                'email'       => $email,
                'description' => 'This is a test form submission.'
              )
            ));

        /* For some reason, the request is generating a 500 error.  Find out
         *  what the problem is:
         */
        echo
          PHP_EOL, PHP_EOL, $this->_browser->getError()
          PHP_EOL, PHP_EOL, $this->_browser->getError()->getTraceAsString();


        /* This assertion will still fail, but not before we get to see what's
         *  going on.
         */
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);
      }
    }

* Since 500 errors are generally not considered to be desirable behavior, you
  will probably end up using this plugin to debug your application rather than
  as part of a test or assertion.

#### Inspecting View Variables
Often in conjunction with troubleshooting 500 errors, it can be useful to
  inspect variables that are sent to the view.

To extract a variable from the test browser context, use the Var plugin:

    # sf_app_module_dir/main/actions/actions.class.php

    class mainActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeCategory( sfWebRequest $request )
      {
        $cat = $request->getParameter('category');
        ...
        $this->listings = ListingTable::getInstance()->findByCategory($cat);
      }
    }

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/main/category.php

    class frontend_main_categoryTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      protected
        $_application = 'frontend',
        $_route       = '@category_view';

      public function testValidCategory(  )
      {
        $this->_browser->usePlugin('var');

        $this->_browser->get($this->_route, array('category' => 'foo'));
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);

        /* Extract listings that were sent to the view. */
        $listings = $this->_browser->getVar('listings');
      }
    }

* The Var plugin interacts with the action's var holder.  If a variable is not
  added to the var holder, the Var plugin will not be able to find it (for
  example, the `$cat` variable in the above example is not accessible to the
  test).

* As it is not used very often, the Var plugin is not enabled by default.
  To use it in your test, call `$this->_browser->usePlugin('var')`.

#### Inspecting Log Messages
Occasionally, it can be useful to look at the log messages generated by a
  particular request.  By default, Symfony will log messages to
  `sf_log_dir/appname_test.log`, but this file tends to get rather large, and
  it can be cumbersome to scroll through it to identify the failed request.

JPUP provides an alternative interface for interacting with Symfony's logger.
  The Logger plugin will inject an `sfVarLogger` instance into the context so
  that you can inspect log messages in your test.

To inject the logger, you will need to first call
  `$this->_browser->usePlugin('logger')`.

Once the logger has been injected, you can inspect the log messages generated by
  the most recent request like this:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/contactus/reportissue.php

    <?php
    class frontend_main_reportissueTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        /* Inject the logger so that we can inspect log messages. */
        $this->_browser->usePlugin('logger');

        $this->_browser
          ->get('@reportissue')
          ->click('Submit', array(
              'issue' => array(
                'firstname'   => 'Functional',
                'lastname'    => 'Tester',
                'email'       => $email,
                'description' => 'This is a test form submission.'
              )
            ));

        /* For some reason, the request is generating a 404.  Maybe the application
         *  logs will hold some clues.
         */
        echo $this->_browser->getLogger(), PHP_EOL;

        /* This assertion will still fail, but not before we get to see what's going
         *  on.
         */
        $this->assertStatusCode(200);
      }
    }

Note that the logger will be injected after the context loads its factories,
  so there will not be any log messages from factory initialization (such as
  connecting routes).

You can work around this by instructing Symfony to load an `sfVarLogger` in
  your `factories.yml` file.  The Logger plugin will first check to see if an
  `sfVarLogger` has been added to the context before injecting its own.

    # sf_app_config_dir/factories.yml:

    test:
      logger:
        class:    sfAggregateLogger
        param:
          level:    debug
          loggers:
            sf_var_logger:
              class:  sfVarLogger
              param:
                level:  debug

With the above configuration in place in your application's `factories.yml`
  file, you will be able to inspect all application log messages in your test
  case, including any generated while initializing the context's factory
  objects (but be aware that this comes at a cost; the `sfVarLogger` will be
  created and populated regardless of whether you use it!).

#### Injecting Event Handlers

From time to time, it might be useful for tests to inject event handlers into
  the browser context.  Since the browser creates a new context for every
  request, this can be tricky to pull off.

`Test_Browser_Listener_Callback` was created to make it easier to accomplish
  exactly this.  To inject an event handler into the browser context, create a
  new instance of `Test_Browser_Listener_Callback` and pass it to
  `Test_Browser->addListener()`.

As an example, consider this test which checks to see if an event handler can
  abort the signin process by setting the event's return value to `false`:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/auth/signin.php:

    class frontend_auth_signinTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testEventHandlerBlocksSignin(  )
      {
        /* Inject event handler that listens for pre-signin event. */
        $this->_browser->addListener(new Test_Browser_Listener_Callback(
          'auth.user.signin.pre',
          array($this, '_blockSignin')
        ));

        /* Simulate submission of login form. */
        $this->_browser->post('@signin', array(
          'username'  => 'foo',
          'password'  => 'bar'
        ));

        $this->assertFalse(
          $this->_browser->getUser()->isAuthenticated(),
          'Expected user to remain unauthenticated.'
        );
      }

      /** Aborts the signin process by setting the event's return value to
       *    false.
       *
       * @param sfEvent $event
       *
       * @return void
       */
      public function _blockSignin( sfEvent $event )
      {
        $event->setReturnValue(false);
      }
    }

`Test_Browser_Listener_Callback->__construct()` accepts a single event name and
  one or more callbacks; e.g.:

    $this->_browser->addListener(new Test_Browser_Listener_Callback(
      'context.load_factories',
        /* Call $this->_initContext() when factories are loaded: */
        array($this, '_initContext'),

        /* Call static method MyClass::doSomething(): */
        array('MyClass', 'doSomething'),

        /* PHP 5.3 closures are also supported: */
        function( sfEvent $event ) { ... }

        // etc.
    ));

# Database Interaction
Note that JPUP is currently only compatible with Doctrine.

## Configuration
Before running any tests, JPUP first verifies to make sure that a distinct
  "test" DSN has been specified in databases.yml and that the active Doctrine
  connection is using the correct DSN.

* If any problems are detected with the test database configuration, JPUP
  outputs an error message and exits immediately to prevent any tests from
  running (and potentially corrupting production data).

To specify a separate DSN for testing, add the following lines to your
  databases.yml file:

    # config/databases.yml

    test:
      doctrine:
        class: sfDoctrineDatabase
        param:
          dsn: "mysql:host=<hostname>;dbname=<test db name>"
          username: "<username>"
          password: "<password>"

Replace the values in brackets above with ones that correspond to your database setup.

* Make sure that you also create the test database and assign user privileges if
    necessary.

* If your application does not use a database, you can disable these checks
  (and all database connectivity) by setting `use_database` to `false` in
  `apps/*/config/settings.yml`:

        # apps/frontend/config/settings.yml

        all:
          .settings:
            ... snip ...
            use_database:           false

## Pre-Test Checks
Before running each test, JPUP automatically flushes the database:

* Before the first test runs, JPUP completely destroys and rebuilds the
  test database:

    * Drop and recreate the test database.

       *  This step is roughly equivalent to calling `php ./symfony
          doctrine:drop-db --env=test` followed by `php ./symfony
          doctrine:build-db --env=test`.

    * Rebuild all tables from model classes.

       *  This step is roughly equivalent to calling `php ./symfony
          doctrine:insert-sql --env=test`.

       *  Because tables are built from model classes, there is no need to worry
          about applying database change scripts or having an up-to-date
          schema.yml file for testing (though it is still a good idea to have
          these things for many other reasons!).

* For efficiency, subsequent tests will truncate all tables instead of
  rebuilding the entire database.

Note that JPUP flushes the database **before** each test, not **after** it.
  This is by design; if you want to inspect the state of the database after a
  failed test, use `exit()` to halt test execution before the failing assertion,
  then use your favorite DB client application to examine the test database.

## Loading Fixtures
To load test fixtures, call `$this->loadFixture()` in your test case, e.g.:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/Hello.php

    <?php
    class HelloTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        /* Load sf_test_dir/fixtures/hello.yml. */
        $this->loadFixture('hello.yml');
      }
    }

### Loading Fixtures for Other Plugins

To load a fixture for another plugin, pass the plugin's name as the third
  parameter to `loadFixture()`:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/Hello.php

    <?php
    class HelloTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        /* Load sf_plugins_dir/myOtherPlugin/test/fixtures/hello.yml. */
        $this->loadFixture('hello.yml', false, 'myOtherPlugin');
      }
    }

## Loading Production Fixtures

Sometimes, it is necessary to load production data fixtures (located in
  `sf_data_dir/fixtures`) during tests.  To load these data fixtures, call
  `$this->loadProductionFixture()` instead, e.g.:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/Ticket.php

    <?php
    class TicketTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        /* Load sf_data_dir/fixtures/ticket_types.yml. */
        $this->loadProductionFixture('ticket_types.yml');
      }
    }

### Production Fixtures for Other Plugins

`loadProductionFixture()` can also be directed to load production fixtures for
  other plugins just like `loadFixture()`:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/Ticket.php

    <?php
    class TicketTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        /* Load sf_plugins_dir/myOtherPlugin/data/fixtures/ticket_types.yml. */
        $this->loadProductionFixture('ticket_types.yml', false, 'myOtherPlugin');
      }
    }

### Caveats
* The database gets flushed in between tests, so you will need to make sure your
  test case loads the appropriate fixtures before every test that uses them.

    * Consider leveraging `_setUp()` for fixtures that must be loaded for every
      test in a test case.

* By default, `loadFixture()` will not load a fixture more than once during a
  test.  There is a way to force it to load a fixture multiple times (but be
  wary of infinite loops!).  See the API documentation for more information.

### Fixture Types
JPUP supports loading three different fixture types:  SQL, YAML, PHP.

#### SQL
A SQL data fixture is simply a SQL script.  When loading a SQL data fixture,
  JPUP loads the contents of the file and passes it to the ORM's `exec()`
  method.

Here is an example of a SQL data fixture in action:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/MyTest.php

    <?php
    class MyTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      public function testFindCategoryByName(  )
      {
        $this->loadFixture('category.sql');

        $category = My::category();

        $this->assertInstanceOf('Category', $category,
          'Expected Category record to be loaded.'
        );

        $this->assertEquals(My::DEFAULT_CATEGORY, $category->name,
          'Expected loaded Category to have correct name.'
        );
      }
    }

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/category.sql

    INSERT INTO `category`
      SET `name` = 'DEFAULT';

##### Pros
- As the simplest data fixture that JPUP supports, SQL fixtures load the most
  quickly and are easy to understand, even by developers who are unfamiliar with
  JPUP or even the ORM.
- Fixture data can be loaded easily into a test database outside the context of
  running a test, making it easier to load fixtures for spikes and other
  exploratory operations.

##### Cons
- SQL data fixtures do not leverage any ORM functionality such as
  behaviors, listeners, validators, events, etc.  It is quite possible to
  create situations using SQL data fixtures that would never occur under normal
  program operation (some might argue that this is a feature).
- SQL data fixtures also do not leverage PHP constants and other "magic values".
  Care should be taken when changing these values to ensure that the values are
  changed both in the application code and any applicable test fixtures.
- For database-agnostic applications, care should be taken to ensure that the
  syntax in SQL data fixtures are also database-agnostic to prevent false
  failures when tests are run with incompatible databases.

#### YAML
JPUP can load YAML fixture files similarly to the way Symfony's
  `doctrine:data-load` task operates.  To load a YAML fixture file, provide the
  name of the file to `$this->loadFixture()`:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/MyTest.php

    <?php
    class MyTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        $this->loadFixture('users.yml');
      }
    }

Here's what the YAML fixture looks like:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/users.yml

    User:
      admin:
        username: admin
        password: password
        active:   1
      editor:
        username: editor
        password: password
        active:   1
      inactive:
        username: haxor
        password: 1337
        active:   0

As with other Symfony YAML files, you can include PHP code, although Symfony
  configuration values are **not** currently expanded:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/users.yml

    User:
      admin:

        # This will not work as expected; username will be literally
        #   "%APP_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME%":
        username: %APP_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME%

        # This will work as expected; password will be
        #   "0698f86248c9592589005ba8b7f1e2e9383964cf":
        password: <?php echo sha1('saltpasswordsalt'); ?>

##### Pros
- Symfony also uses the YAML format for its production data fixtures, so the
  syntax will be familiar even to developers that are unfamiliar with JPUP.

##### Cons
- The YAML format is slower to parse than raw SQL fixtures, and it much is less
  powerful than PHP fixtures.

#### PHP
Load a PHP fixture file identically to the way you would load a YAML fixture
  file, except that the filename will have a '.php' extension rather than
  '.yml':

    # sf_test_dir/unit/lib/MyClass.php

    <?php
    class MyClassTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        $this->loadFixture('articles.php');
      }
    }

A PHP fixture file can contain any PHP code.

* With great power comes great responsibility.  Try to keep your fixtures short,
  simple and focused.  The last thing you want is to have to write test cases
  for your data fixtures!

##### Loading Other Fixtures
You can load other fixtures from a PHP fixture file by calling
  `$this->loadFixture()` and/or `$this->loadProductionFixture()` just like you
  would from a test case:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/articles.php

    <?php
    $this->loadProductionFixture('sites.yml');
    $this->loadFixture('categories.php');

    // Load fixture from another plugin:
    $this->loadFixture('entity_types.php', false, 'myOtherPlugin');

##### Sharing Variables
PHP fixture files can share variables between one other.  To make a variable
  accessible to other fixture files, assign it as a property of `$this` in the
  fixture file:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/articles.php

    <?php
    $this->Article = new Article();
    $this->Article->setTitle('Hello, world!');
    $this->Article->save();

Because `articles.php` defines `$this->Article`, any subsequently-loaded fixture
  can access it:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/categories.php

    <?php
    /* Load dependency fixture. */
    $this->loadFixture('articles.php');

    $Cat = new Category();
    $Cat->setTitle('Standard Content');

    /* Associate the Article object from sf_test_dir/fixtures/articles.php with
     *  the Category object.
     */
    $Cat->setArticle($this->Article);

    $Cat->save();

If you write a fixture that relies on other fixtures being loaded, it is
  recommended that you explicitly call `$this->loadFixture()` in the fixture
  itself to make sure that its dependencies get loaded.

  * In other words, don't rely on the test case to manage fixture dependencies.

  * Remember that `loadFixture()` will not load a fixture more than once per
    test by default, so when in doubt it is always better to include too many
    calls to `loadFixture()` than too few.

##### Accessing Fixture Variables in Test Cases
You can also access shared fixture variables in test cases.  Use
  `$this->getFixtureVar()` to access them:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/site.php

    <?php
    $this->TestSite = new Site();
    $this->TestSite->setName('Tanis Dig');
    $this->TestSite->save();

    # sf_test_dir/unit/model/SiteTable.php

    <?php
    class SiteTableTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      public function testFetchByName(  )
      {
        $this->loadFixture('site.php');

        /* References $this->TestSite from the fixture file. */
        $controlID = $this->getFixtureVar('TestSite')->getId();

        $this->assertEquals(
          $controlID,
          Doctrine::getTable('Site')->fetchByName('Tanis Dig')->getId(),
          'Expected fetched Site object to have correct ID.'
        );
      }
    }

##### Defining Constants
Because the database gets flushed before every test, it might be necessary to
  load a given test fixture several times over the course of a test case.  This
  makes it a little tricky to define constants in a test fixture.

The PHP fixture loader provides a solution:

    # sf_test_dir/fixtures/articles.php

    <?php
    /* Defines the constant TEST_ARTICLE_TITLE if not already defined. */
    $this->define('TEST_ARTICLE_TITLE', 'Hello, World!');

    $Node = new Article();
    $Node->setTitle(TEST_ARTICLE_TITLE);
    $Node->save();

The constant is, naturally, accessible in test cases as well:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/ArticleTable.php

    <?php
    class ArticleTableTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      public function testFetchByTitle(  )
      {
        $this->loadFixture('articles.php');

        /* References TEST_ARTICLE_TITLE constant defined in the articles.php
         *  fixture.
         */
        $Article = Doctrine::getTable('Article')->fetchByTitle(TEST_ARTICLE_TITLE);
        $this->assertFalse(
          $Article->isNew(),
          'Expected fetchByTitle() to find the existing article.'
        );
      }
    }

As with shared fixture variables, constants defined in fixture files are not
  namespaced.  If you are trying to `define()` a constant that was already set
  in another test fixture (or is a built-in PHP constant, set by the Symfony
  framework, etc.), it will silently fail.

To avoid this problem, it is recommended that you adopt a naming convention
 (such as prepending "TEST_" to all test constant names).

##### Pros
- PHP fixtures are by far the most sophisticated and powerful of the data
  fixture formats supported by JPUP, offering a number of features that simply
  aren't possible to accomplish in the other formats.
- Errors in PHP fixtures are accompanied by full stack traces including file and
  line numbers, making it much easier to identify problems with PHP fixtures
  than the other formats.

##### Cons
- Due to their complexity and feature set, PHP fixtures are the most prone to
  logic errors, false positives/failures, etc.
- Although this is not necessarily the case, PHP fixtures tend to be the slowest
  to load of all the fixture formats supported by JPUP, due to the amount of
  overhead incurred (both from the ORM and JPUP).

## Flushing the Database Manually
You can flush the database manually in your test by calling
  `$this->flushDatabase()`.

For example, consider this functional test that verifies that content can be
  exported from one environment and re-imported onto a second environment.

After generating the export files, we flush the database and load a new
  fixture to simulate a separate instance of the application.

    # sf_test_dir/functional/backend/migrate/index.php

    <?php
    class backend_migrate_indexTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      protected
        $_application = 'backend';

      public function testContentMigration(  )
      {
        /* Init the source environment. */
        $this->loadFixture('content_migration_source.php');
        sfConfig::set('app_which_env', 'test-');

        /* Generate content migration files. */
        $this->_browser->get('@migrate_export', array(
          'site_id' => '1',
          'dest'    => 'test2-'
        ));

        /* Verify the export files were created successfully. */
        ... assertions go here ...

        /* Pretend we're now on the destination environment. */
        $this->flushDatabase();

        $this->loadFixture('content_migration_destination.php');
        sfConfig::set('app_which_env', 'test2-');

        /* Load content migration files into destination. */
        $this->_browser->get('@migrate_import', array(
          'site_id' => '1',
          'from'    => 'test-'
        ));

        /* Verify that objects were imported successfully. */
        ... assertions go here ...
      }
    }

* `flushDatabase()` takes an optional `$rebuild` parameter that will force it to
  drop and rebuild the entire database rather than just truncating all the data.

## Rebuilding the Database Between Tests

By default, JPUP does **not** rebuild the database between tests; it only
  flushes the data.

If you are testing a script that modifies the structure of the database, it is
  recommended that you set the `$_alwaysRebuildDB` property of your test case
  to `true` so that the database will be destroyed and rebuilt before *every*
  test in the test case:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/lib/db/DBDestroyer.class.php

    <?php
    class DBDestroyerTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected
        $_alwaysRebuildDB = true;

      ...
    }

# File Uploads
JPUP requires that your project have a separate uploads directory for testing so
  that test execution doesn't overwrite production files.

Even if the code you are testing does not use file uploads explicitly, JPUP
  still requires a separate test upload directory, as the `Test_Browser` class
  might automatically write to that directory during a `post()` operation.

Plus, it's one less thing to worry about when you start testing actions that
  accept file uploads.

By default, JPUP will define and create a test uploads directory for you at
  runtime at `%sf_app_cache_dir%/uploads`.

If you wish to override this value, you can specify a different path in your
  app's `settings.yml` file.

## Removing Uploaded Files
JPUP will automatically remove all files in the test uploads directory before
  each test.

If you need to clear out the uploads directory mid-test, you can call
  `$this->flushUploads()`:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/account/profile.php

    <?php
    class frontend_account_profileTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      public function testDetectMissingAvatar(  )
      {
        /* User uploads an avatar as normal. */
        $this->_browser
          ->get('@profile_avatar')
          ->click('Submit', array(
              'avatar' => sfConfig::get('sf_fixture_dir') . '/uploads/me.jpg'
            ));

        /* Pretend the upload inexplicably failed. */
        $this->flushUploads();

        /* Follow the redirect back to the profile page. */
        $this->_browser->followRedirect();

        $this->assertEquals(
          sfConfig::get('app_missing_avatar'),
          $this->_browser->getContent()->select('#avatar')->getAttribute('src'),
          'Expected "missing avatar" pic to display in place of missing avatar.'
        );
      }
    }

# sfConfig
JPUP automatically restores `sfConfig` values between tests, so you do not have
  to manually reset any `sfConfig` changes during your tests.

If you wish to revert all `sfConfig` values mid-test, call
  `$this->flushConfigs()`:

    # sf_test_dir/unit/lib/ConfigWatcher.class.php

    <?php
    class ConfigWatcherTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      public function testSuccess(  )
      {
        ConfigWatcher::init();

        /* Change a config value. */
        $key = 'app_some_value';
        sfConfig::set($key, 100);

        $this->assertTrue(
          ConfigWatcher::isModified($key),
          'Expected ConfigWatcher to notice when config value is modified.'
        );

        /* Reset the config value. */
        $this->flushConfigs();

        $this->assertFalse(
          ConfigWatcher::isModified($key),
          'Expected ConfigWatcher to notice when config value is reset.'
        );
      }
    }

# Error Reporting
By default, Symfony turns off `E_NOTICE` errors for the `test` environment.
  This can prevent PHPUnit from catching genuine logic errors, so JPUP requires
  that `error_reporting` be set to its most verbose setting in settings.yml.

To fix `error_reporting`, look for the following setting in
  `apps/*/config/settings.yml`:

    # apps/frontend/config/settings.yml

    test:
      .settings:
        error_reporting:        <?php echo ((E_ALL | E_STRICT) ^ E_NOTICE)."\n" ?>

And change it to look like this:

    # apps/frontend/config/settings.yml

    test:
      .settings:
        error_reporting:        <?php echo (E_ALL | E_STRICT)."\n"; ?>

* This feature cannot currently be bypassed.  If your application relies on
  code that generates `E_NOTICE` errors (and you don't want to fix them), you
  will need to make use of PHP's [`@` operator](http://php.net/language.operators.errorcontrol).

# Bootstrap Script
When running PHPUnit Symfony tasks, JPUP will look for and execute the
  bootstrap file in `sf_test_dir/bootstrap/phpunit.php`.  If you have any code that
  needs to be executed before any tests are run, put it in this bootstrap file.

For example, if your project does not have a `frontend` application, you will
  need to specify a different default application for your tests in the
  bootstrap script as noted in the following section.

* The code in this file is executed before an `sfContext` instance gets
  initialized.

* This file is optional.  If JPUP does not find the bootstrap script, it will
  not trigger any errors.

# Specifying the Application Name
By default, JPUP runs tests using the `frontend` application context.  If your
  test (unit or functional) should be run with a different configuration, add an
  `$_application` property to your test class:

    # sf_test_dir/functional/backend/config/set.php

    <?php
    class backend_config_SetTest extends Test_Case_Functional
    {
      protected
        $_application = 'backend';

      ... snip ...
    }

* This feature is primarily intended for functional tests.  Unit tests, by
  definition, should not need to rely on a specific application's configuration.
  If you find yourself using this feature in your unit tests, you should
  strongly consider whether you can use [dependency injection](http://components.symfony-project.org/dependency-injection/trunk/book/01-Dependency-Injection)
  or some other pattern to decouple your library class from your application.

* If your project does not have a `frontend` application, you will need to
  specify a different default value in your bootstrap script:

        # sf_test_dir/bootstrap/phpunit.php

        <?php
        Test_Case::setDefaultApplicationName('appname');

# Specifying the Plugin Name
It is now possible to contain all unit tests and fixtures for a plugin with that
  plugin's directory on the filesystem (functional tests must still be located
  in the project `sf_test_dir/test/functional` directory).

## Plugin Unit Tests
### Files
Store plugin-specific unit tests in `sf_plugins_dir/plugin_name/test/unit`,
  where `plugin_name` is the name of the plugin the test cases belong to.

### Specifying the Plugin Name
In your test case, set the `$_plugin` instance property to the name of the
  plugin:

    <?php
    # sf_plugins_dir/myHelloPlugin/test/unit/lib/Hello.class.php

    class HelloTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected
        $_plugin = 'myHelloPlugin';
    }

### Caveats
#### Loading Fixtures
By default, `loadFixture()` and `loadProductionFixture()` will look in the
  plugin's fixture directory, not the project's.  If you need to load a project
  fixture from a plugin test case, you will need to specify `null` as the third
  parameter to `loadFixture()` and/or `loadProductionFixture()`:

    # sf_plugins_dir/myHelloPlugin/test/unit/Hello.php

    <?php
    class HelloTest extends Test_Case_Unit
    {
      protected
        $_plugin = 'myHelloPlugin';

      protected function _setUp(  )
      {
        // Load sf_plugins_dir/myHelloPlugin/test/fixtures/hello.yml.
        $this->loadFixture('hello.yml');

        // Load sf_test_dir/fixtures/hello.yml.
        $this->loadFixture('hello.yml', false, null);

        // Load sf_plugins_dir/myHelloPlugin/data/fixtures/hello.yml.
        $this->loadProductionFixture('hello.yml');

        // Load sf_data_dir/fixtures/hello.yml.
        $this->loadProductionFixture('hello.yml', false, null);
      }
    }

## Plugin Fixtures
### Files
Store plugin-specific test fixtures in
  `sf_plugins_dir/plugin_name/test/fixtures`, where `plugin_name` is the name of
  the plugin the test fixtures belong to.

### Caveats
#### Loading Other Fixtures
By default, `loadFixture()` and `loadProductionFixture()` will look in the
  plugin's fixture directory, not the project's.  If you need to load a project
  fixture from a plugin test case, you will need to specify `null` as the third
  parameter to `loadFixture()` and/or `loadProductionFixture()`:

    # sf_plugins_dir/myAwesomePlugin/test/fixtures/categories.php

    <?php
    // Load sf_plugins_dir/myAwesomePlugin/test/fixtures/category_types.php.
    $this->loadFixture('category_types.php');

    // Load sf_test_dir/fixtures/category_types.php.
    $this->loadFixture('category_types.php', false, null);

    // Load sf_plugins_dir/myAwesomePlugin/data/fixtures/category_types.yml.
    $this->loadProductionFixture('category_types.yml');

    // Load sf_data_dir/fixtures/category_types.yml.
    $this->loadProductionFixture('category_types.yml', false, null);

# Running Tests
JPUP includes a number of Symfony tasks that you can use to run your tests:

- To run ALL tests: `php ./symfony phpunit:all`
- To run unit tests: `php ./symfony phpunit:unit`
- To run functional tests: `php ./symfony phpunit:functional`

Note:  JPUP is not compatible with Symfony's built-in test tasks.  Do not expect
  `php ./symfony test:*` tasks to work with PHPUnit test cases!

### phpunit:all
<pre>
Usage:
 symfony phpunit:all [-f|--filter="..."] [-g|--groups="..."] [-p|--plugin="..."] [-v|--verbose] [--stop-on-fail]

Options:
 --filter        (-f) Regex used to filter tests; only tests matching the filter will be run.
 --groups        (-g) Only run tests from the specified group(s).
 --plugin        (-p) Run tests for the specified plugin.
 --verbose       (-v) If set, PHPUnit will output additional information (e.g. test names).
 --stop-on-fail  If set, stop on the first failure or error.

Description:
 Runs all PHPUnit tests for the project.
</pre>

* JPUP currently runs all tests in the same PHP instance.  Be aware that a fatal
  runtime error will be generated if there are tests for two classes in
  different applications with the same name (e.g., `mainActions`).

### phpunit:unit
<pre>
Usage:
 symfony phpunit:unit [-f|--filter="..."] [-g|--groups="..."] [-p|--plugin="..."] [-v|--verbose] [--stop-on-fail] [path1] ... [pathN]

Arguments:
 path            Specify the relative paths to specific test files and/or directories under sf_root_dir/test/unit.  If no arguments are provided, all unit tests will be run.

Options:
 --filter        (-f) Regex used to filter tests; only tests matching the filter will be run.
 --groups        (-g) Only run tests from the specified group(s).
 --plugin        (-p) Run tests for the specified plugin.
 --verbose       (-v) If set, PHPUnit will output additional information (e.g. test names).
 --stop-on-fail  If set, stop on the first failure or error.

Description:
 Runs PHPUnit unit tests for the project.
</pre>

* The `path` argument should be a relative path under `sf_test_dir/unit`.  It can
  reference directories or files, and you may omit '.php' or '.class.php' (where
  applicable) from file paths.

  For example, to run the unit tests located in
  `sf_test_dir/unit/lib/WidgetService.class.php` and
  `sf_test_dir/unit/lib/model/doctrine/*`, both of these commands will work:

  * `./symfony phpunit:unit lib/WidgetService lib/model/doctrine`
  * `./symfony phpunit:unit lib/WidgetService.class.php lib/model/doctrine/*`

* If you organize and name your unit test files to mirror your production code
  files, you can leverage readline's autocompletion feature to save yourself
  some typing.

### phpunit:functional
<pre>
Usage:
 symfony phpunit:functional [-f|--filter="..."] [-g|--groups="..."] [-p|--plugin="..."] [-v|--verbose] [--stop-on-fail] [path1] ... [pathN]

Aliases: func

Arguments:
 path            Specify the relative paths to specific test files and/or directories under sf_root_dir/test/functional.  If no arguments are provided, all functional tests will be run.

Options:
 --filter        (-f) Regex used to filter tests; only tests matching the filter will be run.
 --groups        (-g) Only run tests from the specified group(s).
 --plugin        (-p) Run tests for the specified plugin.
 --verbose       (-v) If set, PHPUnit will output additional information (e.g. test names).
 --stop-on-fail  If set, stop on the first failure or error.

Description:
 Runs PHPUnit functional tests for the project.
</pre>

* The `path` argument functions identically to its counterpart for
  `phpunit:unit`, except that the specified paths should be relative to
  `sf_test_dir/functional`.

  For example, to run the functional tests located in
  `sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/api/publish.php` and
  `sf_test_dir/functional/frontend/ajax/*`, both of these commands will work:

  * `./symfony phpunit:functional frontend/api/publish frontend/ajax`
  * `./symfony phpunit:functional frontend/api/publish.php frontend/ajax/*`

* JPUP currently runs all tests in the same PHP instance.  To avoid classloader
  problems, it is recommended that you run functional tests for one application
  at a time.
